# ABARGANA LINES

A Miniature Layout by gosherfed

[CLICK HERE TO VIEW OUR PROJECTS](https://github.com/gosherfed/GOSHERFED-PROJECTS)

DISCLAIMER: Every idea and design in this layout is purely FICTIONAL. The layout uses 100% in-game stock contents.

REQUIREMENTS: ROLLING LINE (the base game)

This is the official page for ABARGANA LINES. This is just a mod for Rolling Line so you'll need to obtain yourself the base game in order to play this.
All latest versions will always be published here.

[NOTE]

This is the project we're planning to work on after finishing the development process for Remil Connert. Don't worry as we'll still be publishing new updates for our previous layout... and the development is NOT YET ended, literally.

(Download links are not available right now. The layout's still in development!)

What you can see right here is (sorta) a sneak-peek of our brand-new Abargana Lines. It'll be featuring multi-regions, working automatic tracks and road traffic, just like the previous layout. But we'll definitely add more enhancements and new stuffs! Abargana Lines is about high speed railways and other than that.

P.S: By the way, it looks... a bit sketchy, right?
